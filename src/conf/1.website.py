# ! Some settings can be different in different languages.
# ! A comment stating (translatable) is used to denote those.
# ! There are two ways to specify a translatable setting:
# ! (a) BLOG_TITLE = "My Blog"
# ! (b) BLOG_TITLE = {"en": "My Blog", "es": "Mi Blog"}
# ! Option (a) is used when you don't want that setting translated.
# ! Option (b) is used for settings that are different in different languages.
